# Robot base

This is a suggested design of the robot base which will be used in the competition. The simple idea of the Base body is: 
- A box on the top of the base to contain the generator and    other electrical components.  
- 4 wheels for movement.
- a hook on the top of the base to hang the balloon on it.
- a robot arm.
- extruded cuts through the body were necessary in order to supply the wheels and the robotic arm with electrical wires.


# Initial morphological analysis:

|  wheels|   |  Attached to the base horizontally     | Attached to the base vertically    |
|  box     | Added on the top of the base       | Included inside the body      |
|   Balloon      | Fixed on the top of the base       | Fixed on the top of the base      |

The chosen design is D1, designed by SOLIDWORK.
