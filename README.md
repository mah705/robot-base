# Robot base

This is a suggested design of the robot base which will be used in the competition. The simple idea of the Base body is: 
- A box on the top of the base to contain the generator and    other electrical components.  
- 4 wheels for movement.
- a hook on the top of the base to hang the balloon on it.
- a robotic arm.
- extruded cuts through the body were necessary in order to supply the wheels and the robotic arm with electrical wires.

Initial morphological analysis:

D2	D1	part
Attached to the base vertically 	Attached to the base horizontally 	wheels
Included inside the body	Added on the top of the base	box
Fixed on the top of the base	Fixed on the top of the base 	Balloon 

The chosen design is D1, designed by SOLIDWORK.
